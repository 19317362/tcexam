Description:
	TCExam is an assessment software system that enables educators and 
	trainers to author, schedule, deliver, and report on surveys, quizzes, 
	tests and exams. The software is used all over the world by 
	universities, schools, companies and independent teachers. TCExam is 
	open source and completely free to use.

	An e-exam (or CBT - Computer Based Testing)is an electronic exam that 
	can be executed by using a personal computer or an equivalent 
	electronic device (e.g. handheld computer).

	The use of e-exam systems, instead of traditional paper-based tests, 
	allows you to simplify the entire exam cycle, including generation, 
	execution, evaluation, presentation and archiving. This simplification 
	allows you to save time and money while improving exams reliability.

	Beyond the aforementioned advantages, TCExam introduces a large number 
	of tools and features to improve the exams total quality.
