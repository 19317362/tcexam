Description:
	TCExam is a Computer Based Assessment (CBA) software system (also know as 
	CBT - Computer Based Testing or e-exam) that enables educators and trainers 
	to author, schedule, deliver, and report on surveys, quizzes, tests and 
	exams.

	TCExam is Free Open Source Software, Web-Based, Platform Independent, 
	Language Independent (includes translations in several languages and RTL 
	support) and conforms to W3C Accessibility and Usability guidelines to 
	provide equal opportunity to people with disabilities, including blind 
	users.

	TCExam is Web-based and it can be installed on almost any server. For users 
	(test-takers), all TCExam requires is a computer or PDA with a Web browser 
	(i.e. Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) and an Internet or Intranet 
	connection to the TCExam Web server. TCExam automates all assessment phases:
	authoring, scheduling, delivering, and reporting. It's easy to use and do 
	not require expensive hardware to run, nor additional commercial software.

	The general advantages of TCExam over traditional 
	Pen-and-Paper Testing (PPT) includes: increased delivery, administration and
	scoring efficiency; reduced costs for many elements of the testing 
	lifecycle; improved test security resulting from electronic transmission and
	encryption; consistency and reliability; faster and more controlled test 
	revision process with shorter response time; faster decision-making as the 
	result of immediate scoring and reporting; unbiased test administration and 
	scoring; fewer response entry and recognition errors; fewer comprehension 
	errors caused by the testing process; improved translation and localization 
	with universal availability of content; new advanced and flexible item 
	types; increased candidate acceptance and satisfaction; evolutionary step 
	toward future testing methodologies.

	Beyond the aforementioned advantages, TCExam introduces several new quality 
	features.
